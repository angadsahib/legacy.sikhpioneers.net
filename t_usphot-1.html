<p>Most of the photos displayed here illustrate mainly Sikh immigration owing to the fact that early settlement from Punjab was predominantly Sikh.  In the early part of this century all immigrants from India were indiscriminately called "hindoo" or "hindu" regardless of religious affiliation.  The term "hindoo" was also sometimes used in a pejorative sense for anyone from that continent. Permission to reproduce any of these photographs must first be obtained from the archive shown in the photo credits.

      circuit court of appeals" and the U.S. Supreme Court decided against granting

Although most of the outward signs of faith were practiced among only the most religious of the early Sikh immigrants, like their fellow Muslims they were strict about death rituals.  When a Sikh died, a funeral photograph was taken of the deceased wearing a turban, whether or not he had worn one in the United States.  The photo was then sent home to assure family members of the man's orthodoxy.

U.S. until 1989, when she was reunited with her husband. Chancal Singh Rai was a farmer and philanthropist who became a major donor to Fremont and Rideout Medical Centers and dontaed land for the Sikh Temple on Bogue Road (Yuba City, California).  He helped many East Indian students attent Yuba College (California) and loaned money to others to start businesses.
